This repository has been created to share worked completed on the Univeristy of Bristol's (Applied Data Science) COMSM0055 unit. Below is the abstract of the paper, please see the ```report.pdf``` for the full text.

This study applies a multi-model NLP approach
over 2.8 million tweets related to the 2024 U.S. presidential
election; integrating BERTopic for topic modelling, BERTweet
for sentiment and irony detection, RoBERTa for occupational
inference, and M3Inference for demographic estimation. As a
result, multiple dimensions of the political discourse are captured.
The model outputs are validated against external indicators,
including mainstream news headlines, market movements, and
economic sentiment indices. Key findings reveal a persistent
negative bias in tweets, nuanced demographic and occupational
patterns in discourse participation, and limited alignment be-
tween Twitter topics and traditional media coverage. Overall,
this work demonstrated the ability of multiple NLP methods
to extract nuanced insights and explores the strengths and
weaknesses of using a combination of NLP models to analyse
the discourse around the 2024 U.S. election.
